# NanoEncoder alternatives
The following are projects much cooler and feature rich than NanoEncoder, at the cost of additional dependencies and minor increase in complexity. Neither support batch processing, at a glance.

## [ab-av1](https://github.com/alexheretic/ab-av1) by alexheretic (Recommended)
- Has "auto encode" which automatically determines a best CRF (super hype)
- Has builtin vmaf by Netflix (a more accurate way of determining quality than SSIM)
- Cute progress bars

## [Av1an](https://github.com/rust-av/Av1an) by rust-av
- High quality re-encoder with targeting options
- Parallelized processes
- Better crash recovery
- Cute progress bars
