# Terms of Service (Terms of Use)

You are solely responsible for your media. Re-encdoing like this is inherently destructive, meaning it's irreversible. There are many safety measures in place (like explicit confirmation when deleting media) to guard the user from accidental dataloss, but is still possible.

Per the licensing of this project:
> IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

Permanent deletion (via `--perm` or other alias for this flag), also known as unlinking, is irreversible. Data recovery would need to be employed to relink/recover this data, granted it hasn't been written over already. This is strictly the users responsibility.
