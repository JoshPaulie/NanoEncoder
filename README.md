# NanoEncoder
A lightweight ffmpeg wrapper to reduce your video collection size (while preserving quality)

> [!warning]
>  Project in "Beta", feedback on small sample sizes welcome. Refrain from running on large portions of your media until full first release (on PyPI) ðŸ˜„

**NanoEncoder** is for local media nerds who want to save storage space without sacrificing video quality. It provides:

- Smart batch processing of video directories into HEVC (h.265)
- Detailed reporting of space savings
- Safe cleanup of original files (only when you're ready)

## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.13+ (if not installing via `uv`)
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) (including `ffprobe`) 7.1+ installed system-wide

### uv (Recommended)
> [!note]
> uv allows you to install Python apps without even having Python itself installed.
>
> Check it out [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). This is the preferred method for my friends wanting to use the NanoEncoder

```bash
# PyPI package coming soonâ„¢
uv tool install git+https://github.com/JoshPaulie/NanoEncoder.git
```

Check out the [installation](https://bexli.dev/NanoEncoder/installation) page for more details.

## Usage

### Preferred workflow

1. **Test first**: Copy a small sample to a test directory and optimize it
2. **Check quality**: Run a health check on the test results
3. **Iterate if needed**: If quality isn't satisfactory, adjust settings and re-test
4. **Scale up**: Once satisfied, delete test files and optimize your entire collection
5. **Final steps**: Run health check, purge originals, and untag optimized files

```bash
nen optimize '/media/series/The Office (US)' # Re-encode a directory with HEVC (h.265)
nen health '/media/series/The Office (US)'  # Compare the original and optimized video files via SSIM
nen purge '/media/series/The Office (US)'  # Safely remove original files (sends to trash)
nen untag '/media/series/The Office (US)' # Remove the "tags" left behind by NanoEncoder
```

### YOLO

The "YOLO" workflow handles purging and untagging videos after successfully being optimized, but doesn't allow the user to perform a healthcheck prior to removing originals.

This is great if you trust CRF to do a "good enough" job, or if you have limited disk space (i.e. you can't store both the original and optimizes versions at the same time)

```sh
nen optimize --replace '/media/series/The Office (US)' # Optimize with default CRF, but delete original and untag new files, effectively "replacing" the file with an HEVC version.
```

## Features
- **Greatly reduce file sizes** for videos by re-encoding with h.265/HEVC
- **Crossplatform**, tested on Windows, Linux, and MacOS
- Perfectly handles **multiple subtitle and audio tracks**[^1] (GREAT for anime)
- **CPU Multithreading** by default
- **Smart batch processing** skips already processed videos and recovers incomplete files
- **Dynamic bit allocation** with [CRF](docs/about-crf.md)
- **High fault tolerance**! If you have a power outage while encoding, you can simply run the script against the same directory, and it will pick up at the video where it left off[^2]

### Safety Measures
- No silent deletions: `purge` requires explicit user confirmation, and sends originals to system recycling bin
- Crash detection: Handles partially optimized files
- Comprehensive logging: All operations are recorded in a log file (varying locations depending on OS)

[^1]: By literally not touching them at all and copying them as-is. ðŸ˜Ž
[^2]: Well, near where it left off. It will delete the partially-encoded file (denoted by .optimizing still being in the name), and re-encode the original.
[^3]: Use `NanoEncoder.py optimize -h` for more details
