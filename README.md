# NanoEncoder
A lightweight ffmpeg wrapper to reduce your video collection size (while preserving quality)

> [!warning]
> Core functionality works, customization features and logging changes underway. Project in "Beta", feedback on small sample sizes welcome. Refrain from running on large portions of your media until full first release (with PyPI release) ðŸ˜„

**NanoEncoder** is for local media nerds who want to save storage space without sacrificing video quality. It provides:

- Batch processing of video directories
- Auto skips already optimized files
- Detailed reporting of space savings
- Safe cleanup of original files (only when you're ready)

## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.13+ (if not installing via `uv`)
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) installed system-wide

### uv (Recommended)
> [!note]
> uv allows you to install Python apps without even having Python itself installed.
>
> Check it out [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). This is the preferred method for my friends wanting to use the NanoEncoder

```bash
# Install latest version
uv tool install git+https://github.com/JoshPaulie/NanoEncoder.git

# Update installation to latest
uv tool upgrade nanoencoder

# Uninstall NanoEncoder
uv tool uninstall nanoencoder

# Verify functionality
nen -h
```

### pipx
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/JoshPaulie/NanoEncoder.git
nen -h
```

## Usage
The CLI has 2 commands: `encode` and `purge`. Each take a directory to transact against.

> [!important]
> When optimizing a series, it's recommended you copy a few episodes to their own folder and experiment with the `--crf` flag.
>
> Once you're sure you have a setting you like, you can confidently process the whole thing (assuming they're all of the same quality, like if you downloaded a series from the internet)

```bash
nen encode '/media/series/The Office (US)' # Recursively find all videos and begin re-encoding
nen purge '/media/series/The Office (US)'  # Recursively remove original (source) files

nen encode --crf 28 '/media/series/Berserk (1997)' # Encode at specified CRF (Default is 23)
```

### Encode subcommand
`encode` is used to re-encode entire directories. Files are found recursively, meaning all video files (regardless if they're nested in other directories) are found and processed.

- While encoding, the files will have **.optimizing** inserted before the file extention.
- After encoding, the files will have **.optimized** inserted before the file extention.

### Purge subcommand
`purge` is used to delete any original source files which have a corresponding optimized file. Meant to be ran against a directory after using `encode`.

## Features
- **Greatly reduce file sizes** for videos by re-encoding with h.265/HEVC (even videos already with this encoding will still see a reduction in size)
- Perfectly handles **multiple subtitle and audio tracks**[^1]
- **CPU Multithreading** by default
- **Smart batch processing** skips already processed videos and recovers incomplete files
- **Dynamic bit allocation** with [CRF](#about-crf)
- **High fault tolerance**! If you have a power outage while encoding, you can simply run the script against the same directory, and it will pick up at the video where it left off[^2]

### Safety Measures
- No silent deletions: `purge` requires explicit user confirmation
- Crash detection: Handles partially encoded files
- Comprehensive logging: All operations are recorded in `~/NanoEncoder.log`, and FFmpeg logs  arerecorded in `~/NanoEncoder_ffmpeg.log`

## Quality of optimized videos
Video quality will remain perceptively the same, unless it's an outrageously highly detailed source file. You may see a decrease in quality, the higher the definition. Movies and shows at 1080p are best suited for NanoEncoder.

- Live action shows and movies may have minor loss in quality.
- Anime content seem to lose no noticeable loss in quality, and are the ideal usecase.

### About CRF (Constant Rate Factor)
CRF is the primary quality/size control setting for h.265 and h.264 encoders. It adjusts the trade-off between **file size** and **visual quality** by dynamically allocating bits where needed.

> [!note]
> CRF is **not the same as bitrate**â€”it adapts per scene, saving space in simpler frames while preserving detail in complex ones.

#### Recommended Values
| CRF   | Use Case                                     |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 16-18 | Archival/master quality (large files)        |
| 19-22 | High quality (good balance)                  |
| 23-26 | Default (great for streaming/local playback) |
| 27-30 | Smaller files (some quality loss)            |
| 31+   | Low-bitrate (not recommended for HD)         |

NanoEncoder defaults to **CRF 23**. Adjust based on your storage needs with the `nen encode --crf [0]` flag.

> [!warning]
> Too low of CRF (<18) may actually INCREASE the size of your file!
>
> How? Why? No idea. Just be aware. Always perform a small sample before processing an entire series.

## ffmpeg settings
The following command is what is ran against all found video files (though, the crf can be changed via flag[^3])

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -crf 23 -preset fast -threads 0 -c:a copy -c:s copy -loglevel error output.mp4
```

[^1]: By literally not touching them at all and copying them as-is. ðŸ˜Ž
[^2]: Well, near where it left off. It will delete the partially-encoded file (denoted by .optimizing still being in the name), and re-encode the original.
